# Dev Summit 2019 Presentations

Presentations for the 3D JavaScript API at the 2019 ESRI Developer Summit

## Interactive 3D Maps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

Discover the 3D capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and learn how to leverage them to build stunning 3D web applications.

### Getting Started

This session will focus on the fundamental 3D building blocks of the API: SceneView, 2D and 3D layers, terrain, and symbology.

### Beyond the Basics

This session will focus on more advanced aspects like setting and animating the viewpoint, controlling the environment, and displaying as much data as possible while considering performance.

## 3D with WebGL in ArcGIS

ArcGIS contains a rich set of experiences for delivering 3D web applications with WebGL from the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to the Scene Viewer, Web AppBuilder, and configurable Templates. ArcGIS JavaScript capabilities use WebGL to render 3D in the browser with no plug-ins. This session will provide a brief overview of the capabilities and relationships of Esri's JavaScript 3D offerings along with demos and tips showing what can be done with web-based 3D apps. Presenters will also touch on technologies such as Scene Layers, mobile apps, and how they relate to JavaScript experiences.

## Advanced WebGL in 3D Scene Views with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

Find out how to use WebGL and WebGL-based 3D rendering engines like three.js to implement custom visualizations in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

[4D Volume Rendering Demo using the ArcGIS JS API external renderer API](https://esri.github.io/devsummit-2019-3D-jsapi/Advanced-WebGL-in-3D-SceneViews/External-Volume-Renderer/). This application integrates an external WebGL rendering application into a SceneView. Beware: Due to the large size of volume data sets, this application loads 25MB of data per time step. WebGL 2.0 required.

### Installing

The [4D Volume Rendering Demo](https://esri.github.io/devsummit-2019-3D-jsapi/Advanced-WebGL-in-3D-SceneViews/External-Volume-Renderer/) can be installed locally for better performance. The data is stored in ```git lfs``` (Large File Storage). Install a local webserver to serve the checked out repository and follow the following steps:

* Install git-lfs (for example using ```brew install git-lfs``` or ```apt install git-lfs```)
* Clone the repository with lfs: ```git lfs clone https://github.com/Esri/devsummit-2019-3D-jsapi.git```
* Open ```localhost://.../devsummit-2019-3D-jsapi/Advanced-WebGL-in-3D-SceneViews/External-Volume-Renderer/``` in your browser


## Using TypeScript with ArcGIS API for JavaScript

In this session we will learn some of the basics of TypeScript and how it can help you as a developer using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. We will also look at how to set up a development environment and use the provided TypeScript definition files.
